This document provides a developer-friendly breakdown of the tasks needed to implement the Agent Module for our AI agent framework. Each section includes clear, actionable tasks with deliverables and acceptance criteria to guide the implementation process.

## 1.1. Role-Based Agents

### Task 1: Define Agent Roles and Responsibilities
- **Action Items:**
  - **Identify and List Roles:**  
    - Create a list of required agent roles (e.g., Data Fetcher, Analyzer, Decision-Maker).
    - Document each role's purpose, inputs, outputs, and interactions.
  - **Deliverable:**  
    - A markdown document (e.g., `agent_roles.md`) listing roles with detailed descriptions.
  - **Acceptance Criteria:**  
    - The document covers all major agent functions and is approved by the team lead.

### Task 2: Design Modular Agent Interfaces
- **Action Items:**
  - **Interface Specification:**  
    - Define abstract classes or interfaces for agents using language-agnostic design patterns.
    - Specify required methods (e.g., `initialize()`, `execute()`, `shutdown()`).
  - **Deliverable:**  
    - A code repository folder (e.g., `/interfaces`) containing interface definitions and documentation.
  - **Acceptance Criteria:**  
    - Interfaces are consistent across roles and reviewed through code review.

### Task 3: Implement Agent Templates and Factories
- **Action Items:**
  - **Base Class Creation:**  
    - Develop base classes that implement common functionality for agents.
    - Include hooks for customization (e.g., callback functions, event hooks).
  - **Factory Methods:**  
    - Implement factory methods or use dependency injection to instantiate agents dynamically.
  - **Deliverable:**  
    - A module (e.g., `/agents/base.py` and `/agents/factory.py`) with documented code examples.
  - **Acceptance Criteria:**  
    - Unit tests for agent creation pass, and the module is integrated into the CI pipeline.

### Task 4: Develop and Integrate Testing Frameworks
- **Action Items:**
  - **Unit Testing:**  
    - Write unit tests for each interface and base class.
    - Use mocks/stubs to simulate agent interactions.
  - **Integration Testing:**  
    - Set up integration tests to simulate workflows among different agents.
  - **Deliverable:**  
    - Test suite located in `/tests/agent_module/` with clear instructions on running tests.
  - **Acceptance Criteria:**  
    - All tests pass in the CI/CD environment, and code coverage meets the target threshold.

## 1.2. Lifecycle Management

### Task 1: Initialization and Configuration
- **Action Items:**
  - **Configuration Management:**  
    - Define configuration file formats (e.g., YAML or JSON) and environment variable usage.
    - Develop initialization routines that load configurations and allocate resources.
  - **Deliverable:**  
    - A configuration module (e.g., `/config/config_manager.py`) with sample config files.
  - **Acceptance Criteria:**  
    - Agents initialize correctly using provided configurations, verified by automated tests.

### Task 2: Monitoring and Error Handling
- **Action Items:**
  - **Logging Implementation:**  
    - Integrate a logging library and standardize log formats.
    - Implement logging at key lifecycle events (startup, execution, error, shutdown).
  - **Health Checks and Alerts:**  
    - Develop periodic health checks for agents and integrate with an alerting system.
    - Define error recovery strategies (e.g., retry mechanisms).
  - **Deliverable:**  
    - A logging and health monitoring module (e.g., `/monitoring/logger.py` and `/monitoring/health_check.py`).
  - **Acceptance Criteria:**  
    - Health check tests simulate failures and verify that alerts and recovery actions are triggered.

### Task 3: Shutdown Procedures
- **Action Items:**
  - **Graceful Termination:**  
    - Create shutdown routines that ensure ongoing tasks complete or are safely terminated.
    - Implement resource cleanup routines to close open connections and free memory.
  - **Deliverable:**  
    - Shutdown handlers in the agent base class and a dedicated module for cleanup operations.
  - **Acceptance Criteria:**  
    - Automated tests simulate shutdown conditions, ensuring no resource leaks or orphan processes.

## Summary and Next Steps

1. **Documentation:**  
   - Prepare detailed markdown documents for roles, interface designs, and configuration guidelines.
2. **Code Artifacts:**  
   - Develop the interface, base classes, factory methods, and lifecycle management modules as outlined.
3. **Testing Suite:**  
   - Write and integrate unit and integration tests to cover each component.

**Project Management Notes:**
- **Timeline:**  
  - Task breakdown is expected to be completed over the next 2-3 sprints.
- **Communication:**  
  - Regular stand-up meetings will address progress, roadblocks, and code review feedback.
- **Code Repository:**  
  - All code should be pushed to the designated Git repository with branch names prefixed by `feature/agent-module-`.

This task breakdown provides a clear roadmap for developers to start the implementation of the Agent Module. Each task is actionable with deliverables and acceptance criteria that ensure the implementation is modular, testable, and scalable.
