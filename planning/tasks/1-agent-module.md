## 1.1. Role-Based Agents

### Task 1: Define Agent Roles and Responsibilities
- **Action Items:**
  - **Identify and List Roles:**  
    - Create a list of required agent roles (e.g., Data Fetcher, Analyzer, Decision-Maker).
    - Document each role's purpose, inputs, outputs, and interactions.
  - **Deliverable:**  
    - A markdown document (e.g., `agent_roles.md`) listing roles with detailed descriptions.
  - **Acceptance Criteria:**  
    - The document covers all major agent functions and is approved by the team lead.

**Status:** Completed. The `agent_roles.md` file has been created and contains detailed descriptions of all major agent roles.

### Task 2: Design Modular Agent Interfaces
- **Action Items:**
  - **Interface Specification:**  
    - Define abstract classes or interfaces for agents using language-agnostic design patterns.
    - Specify required methods (e.g., `initialize()`, `execute()`, `shutdown()`).
  - **Deliverable:**  
    - A code repository folder (e.g., `/interfaces`) containing interface definitions and documentation.
  - **Acceptance Criteria:**  
    - Interfaces are consistent across roles and reviewed through code review.

**Status:** Completed. The `Agent` interface is implemented in `/pkg/interfaces/agent.go` with methods for initialization, execution, and shutdown.

### Task 3: Implement Agent Templates and Factories
- **Action Items:**
  - **Base Class Creation:**  
    - Develop base classes that implement common functionality for agents.
    - Include hooks for customization (e.g., callback functions, event hooks).
  - **Factory Methods:**  
    - Implement factory methods or use dependency injection to instantiate agents dynamically.
  - **Deliverable:**  
    - A module (e.g., `/agents/base.py` and `/agents/factory.py`) with documented code examples.
  - **Acceptance Criteria:**  
    - Unit tests for agent creation pass, and the module is integrated into the CI pipeline.

**Status:** Completed. Enhanced `BaseAgent` implemented with lifecycle management, state tracking, event system, and retry mechanisms. `AgentFactory` completed with dynamic agent creation capabilities, configuration loading, and agent registry.

### Task 4: Develop and Integrate Testing Frameworks
- **Action Items:**
  - **Unit Testing:**  
    - Write unit tests for each interface and base class.
    - Use mocks/stubs to simulate agent interactions.
  - **Integration Testing:**  
    - Set up integration tests to simulate workflows among different agents.
  - **Deliverable:**  
    - Test suite located in `/tests/agent_module/` with clear instructions on running tests.
  - **Acceptance Criteria:**  
    - All tests pass in the CI/CD environment, and code coverage meets the target threshold.

**Status:** Completed. Comprehensive tests implemented for agent classes, configuration system, agent factory, and workflow integration in the `/internal/agents/` directory.

## 1.2. Lifecycle Management

### Task 1: Initialization and Configuration
- **Action Items:**
  - **Configuration Management:**  
    - Define configuration file formats (e.g., YAML or JSON) and environment variable usage.
    - Develop initialization routines that load configurations and allocate resources.
  - **Deliverable:**  
    - A configuration module (e.g., `/config/config_manager.py`) with sample config files.
  - **Acceptance Criteria:**  
    - Agents initialize correctly using provided configurations, verified by automated tests.

**Status:** Completed. Implemented `ConfigManager` in `/pkg/agents/config/config_manager.go` with support for JSON and YAML configurations, environment variable overrides, and default settings. Sample configuration file created in `/configs/agents/agents.json`.

### Task 2: Monitoring and Error Handling
- **Action Items:**
  - **Logging Implementation:**  
    - Integrate a logging library and standardize log formats.
    - Implement logging at key lifecycle events (startup, execution, error, shutdown).
  - **Health Checks and Alerts:**  
    - Develop periodic health checks for agents and integrate with an alerting system.
    - Define error recovery strategies (e.g., retry mechanisms).
  - **Deliverable:**  
    - A logging and health monitoring module (e.g., `/monitoring/logger.py` and `/monitoring/health_check.py`).
  - **Acceptance Criteria:**  
    - Health check tests simulate failures and verify that alerts and recovery actions are triggered.

**Status:** Completed. Enhanced logging system implemented in `/pkg/monitoring/logger.go` with multiple log levels, formatting, and file/console output. Comprehensive health check system implemented in `/pkg/monitoring/health_check.go` with status monitoring, alerting, and automatic retry mechanisms.

### Task 3: Shutdown Procedures
- **Action Items:**
  - **Graceful Termination:**  
    - Create shutdown routines that ensure ongoing tasks complete or are safely terminated.
    - Implement resource cleanup routines to close open connections and free memory.
  - **Deliverable:**  
    - Shutdown handlers in the agent base class and a dedicated module for cleanup operations.
  - **Acceptance Criteria:**  
    - Automated tests simulate shutdown conditions, ensuring no resource leaks or orphan processes.

**Status:** Completed. Implemented `GracefulShutdown` method in `BaseAgent` with timeout handling, context cancellation, and resource cleanup. Added proper shutdown handling for continuous monitoring agents.

## 1.3. Additional Enhancements (POC Extensions)

### Task 1: Agent-Workflow Integration
- **Action Items:**
  - **Adapter Components:**  
    - Create an adapter layer to bridge agents with workflow orchestration system.
    - Implement task wrappers for agents to enable workflow participation.
  - **Deliverable:**  
    - An agent-task adapter module that integrates agents with the workflow system.
  - **Acceptance Criteria:**  
    - Agents can be incorporated into workflows and executed in sequence or parallel.

**Status:** Completed. Implemented agent-task adapter in `/pkg/agents/adapter/agent_adapter.go` with support for dependency specifications, input/output handling, and result callbacks.

### Task 2: Agent Communication
- **Action Items:**
  - **Messaging Mechanism:**  
    - Create adapters to connect agents to the messaging system.
    - Implement message handlers for inter-agent communication.
  - **Deliverable:**  
    - A messaging adapter for agents and example message handlers.
  - **Acceptance Criteria:**  
    - Agents can send and receive messages through the messaging system.

**Status:** Completed. Added `AgentMessagingAdapter` to integrate agents with the messaging system, with support for message handlers, agent registry, and asynchronous message processing.

### Task 3: Example Application
- **Action Items:**
  - **Workflow Demo:**  
    - Create an example application demonstrating the Agent module in action.
    - Document usage patterns and best practices.
  - **Deliverable:**  
    - An example application with documentation.
  - **Acceptance Criteria:**  
    - The example demonstrates multiple agents collaborating in a workflow.

**Status:** Completed. Created a comprehensive example application in `/examples/agent_workflow/` that demonstrates agent lifecycle, workflow orchestration, messaging, health monitoring, and configuration management.

## Summary and Next Steps

1. **Documentation:**  
   - All components of the Agent module have been fully documented, including README files with usage instructions and code comments.
2. **Code Artifacts:**  
   - All required components for the Agent module POC have been implemented, including interfaces, base classes, configuration management, health monitoring, and workflow integration.
3. **Testing Suite:**  
   - Comprehensive unit and integration tests have been implemented to validate all components of the Agent module.

**Project Management Notes:**
- **Completion Status:**  
  - All planned tasks for the Agent module POC have been completed successfully.
- **Next Phase:**  
  - The next phase could focus on state persistence, remote agent execution, and a monitoring dashboard.
- **Code Repository:**  
  - All implemented code is located in the designated repository structure as specified in the project requirements.

The Agent Module POC now provides a strong foundation for building complex, role-based agent systems with proper lifecycle management, configuration, monitoring, error handling, and workflow integration. The system is ready for real-world use cases and further extensions.
