# Beluga

Beluga is an AI Agent platform designed in Go. It empowers developers to create multi-agent workflows and seamlessly integrate knowledge bases, streamlining complex development processes. With its modular architecture and focus on scalability, Beluga is the ideal foundation for building intelligent, collaborative systems.

## ATTENTION
This project is an experimental endeavor to develop a complex software platform entirely using AI. Every aspect of Beluga, from design to implementation, is guided by AI-driven processes. As such, the project serves as both a functional tool and a case study in AI-assisted development.
